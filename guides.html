    Nuwera Eliya is a city in the Central province of Sri Lanka that is filled with many tourist attractions. Let me suggest travel ideas and places to visit when we travel via the Peradeniya (A5 route). After passing Gampola, we can feel the cool climate and upon passing Pussellawa we can encounter tea estates. As a refreshing stop for our trip, we can use ‘Appachige Kade’, where most of the travelers use this shop for breakfast and refreshments. Beyond Tawalantenne, we can feel the cool climate very well accompanied by many curvy roads. We can catch distant views of Gerandi Ella, Puna Falls and after passing Puna Falls viewpoint, we’ll encounter Ramboda Falls and we can travel through Ramboda Cave. After passing Ramboda Cave, there are main two tea estates that travelers usually visit; ‘Blue Field’ tea factory and ‘Damro’ tea plantations. Usually, many of the travelers use ‘Damro’ viewpoint to get photos. After passing ‘Damro’ tea plantation, we can enter to Nuwara Eliya. 
    Now, let’s explore each tourist attraction in Nuwara Eliya one by one. These destinations include budget friendly places for University students.

After trekking through tea plantations, one reaches the top where there is just 1 single tree. This is the 7th highest mountain in Sri Lanka and is easily accessible. If one gets to the top around 5.30 a.m. – 7.00 a.m. one can see the best cloud formations around Sri Lanka and also the reflection of the mountain through Gregory Lake.

    The water of the 8m-high  Kadiyanlena Ella Falls cascades down in stages. Although the flow is otherwise languid, during rain the fall is transformed into a rushing body of water, the spray reaching the nearby road. This is a beautiful waterfall where we can take many beautiful photographs.
